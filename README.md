# GNU Assembler, Linker, and Emulator Project

## Overview

This project implements an **assembler, linker, and emulator** for a custom assembly language using **GNU Assembler (GAS)** tools. The project involves lexical and syntax analysis, code generation, linking, and execution of the generated machine code through an emulator. The project build is managed via a **Makefile**, and **Flex** and **Bison** are used to handle the lexical and syntactic analysis.

### Features

- **Assembler**: Converts assembly language into machine code using GNU Assembler.
- **Linker**: Combines object files generated by the assembler into a single executable.
- **Emulator**: Simulates the execution of the machine code generated by the assembler and linker.
- **Lexical and Syntax Analysis**: Performed using **Flex** and **Bison** to tokenize and parse assembly language instructions.
- **Makefile Integration**: Builds the entire project with a single command.

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains the source code for the assembler, linker, and emulator.
  - **/lexer**: Flex files for lexical analysis.
  - **/parser**: Bison files for syntax analysis.
  - **/assembler**: Implements the assembler functionality.
  - **/linker**: Implements the linker to create executable files from object files.
  - **/emulator**: Implements the CPU emulator that simulates execution of the generated machine code.
- **/examples**: Contains sample assembly language programs for testing.
- **/tests**: Contains test cases for different stages of the project (assembly, linking, and emulation).

## Requirements

- **GNU Make**: To manage the build process.
- **Flex**: For
